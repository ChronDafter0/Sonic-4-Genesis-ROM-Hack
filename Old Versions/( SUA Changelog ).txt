Chron's Note:
I halted work on the project for a while because of school 
and... personal issues, but those are personal issues (lol). I 
took a break and began working on it during the beginning 
of April. I then decided to work on trying to recreate 
Turret 3471's Sonic 4 Genesis in Deflemask, cause I thought 
that he used midis from VGMusic. I used that and decided to 
try recreating that OST. Then, I decided that the ROM that 
I created that day seemed good enough to put in the 
"SUA Prototypes + Changelog" folder.
