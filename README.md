# Sonic 4 Genesis/Mega Drive ROM Hack
Sonic the Hedgehog 4 was received poorly due to a collection of errors. The errors in question were poorly made physics, a grating soundtrack, and poorly redone levels taken from Sonic 1 and 2. Aside all the bad reviews, there is a subset of people who enjoyed the episodes. I am in that subset, and have gained the inspiration to make this garbage that I call a rom hack. What have I started.
